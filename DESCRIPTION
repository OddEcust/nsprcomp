Title: Non-Negative Sparse PCA
Description: Performs a constrained principal component analysis (PCA) on the
    given data matrix, where non-negativity and/or sparsity constraints are
    enforced on the principal axes. Each principal component (PC) is computed
    using expectation-maximization iterations, and several deflation methods
    are provided to compute subsequent PCs. The results are returned as an
    object of class 'nsprcomp', which inherits from 'prcomp'.
