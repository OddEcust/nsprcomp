Title: Non-Negative Sparse PCA
Description: This package implements two methods for performing a
    constrained principal component analysis (PCA) on the
    given data matrix, where non-negativity and/or sparsity constraints are
    enforced on the principal axes. The function 'nsprcomp' computes
    one principal component (PC) after another, and several deflation methods
    are provided to compute subsequent PCs. The function 'nscumcomp' jointly
    computes all PCs such that the cumulative variance is maximized. Both
    functions have the same interface as the 'prcomp' function from the 'stats'
    package (plus some extra parameters), and both return the result of the
    analysis as an object of class 'nsprcomp', which inherits from 'prcomp'.
